To set your game mode, open Trials.py with any text editor and change the value of GAME_MODE on line 4 to the corresponding value in the list below (don't put the parenthesis). For example, to play the Wolfer trial it will look like the line below.

GAME_MODE = 11

Disclaimer: Game modes 0, 1, and 11 should work, but I can't guarantee that any game mode other than normal will work as expected or will not crash.
